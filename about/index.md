### Patrick (Slashdoom)

Hi, I'm Patrick, also known as slashdoom online.  For over 20 years, I've navigated the ever-changing world of IT as an engineer.  My expertise lies in network engineering, but I've also worn many hats - network architect, systems engineer, and even software developer.  This blog and portfolio is a window into some of my experiences and the things that keep me passionate about the ever-evolving field of IT.
